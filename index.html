          MS-DOS ("Microsoft Disk Operating System") is a single-user, single-tasking computer operating system that uses a command line 
          interface. Single-tasking means that it can only run one program at a time. In August 1981, This operating system was launched
          by Microsoft In spite of its very small size and relative simplicity, MS-DOS became a very successful operating sytem that led
          to the development of many other operating systems; DR-DOS, FreeDOS, OpenDOS and PC-DOS.
