          MS-DOS ("Microsoft Disk Operating System") is a single-user, single-tasking computer operating system that uses a command line 
          interface. Single-tasking means that it can only run one program at a time. In spite of its very small size and relative
          simplicity, MS-DOS became a very successful operating sytem that led to the development of many other operating systems;
          DR-DOS, FreeDOS, OpenDOS and PC-DOS. <br> Read more on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/ms-dos.html">Linfo</a>.
